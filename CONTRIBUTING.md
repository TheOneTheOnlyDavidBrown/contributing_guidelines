These are the guidelines to contribute to a project by me (David Brown). Feel free to reference these instructions on your projects.

###Contributing

* Fork the repository.
* Create a feature branch with an appropriate name. (`git checkout -b cool-new-feature`)
* Write awesome code
* Run test if they exist and add tests for your feature
* Commit your changes to the feature branch.
* Once satisfied, create a pull request. If there is an existing ticket, reference it in the description. Be sure to include a description of the change and why it adds value.
